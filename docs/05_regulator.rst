This role encompasses the regulatory users who update the licensure details of
facilities.

Viewing Facilities
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A regulatory user is only allowed to see facilities under their regulatory
body. E.g a regulatory user belonging to Kenya Medical Practitioners and
Dentists Board (KMPDB) will only see facilities regulated by by KMPDB.

To list facilities the user clicks on the ``facilities`` tab on the main
navigation bar as the screen below shows.
