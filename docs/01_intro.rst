Login

In-order for a user to access the functionality of the administration system,
one has to be logged in.
A sample login screen is shown in the figure below.
The *email* OR *employee number* plus the user password is required to login to
the system.
On pressing the ``Login`` button, the details entered are validated and
one is allowed access if the details are correct. Otherwise, access is denied.

Resetting a forgotten password
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In case one has forgotten their password, on the login screen there is a
``forgot password`` link such as the one shown below.

On clicking the link, a screen where a person enters their email is displayed.

Once a user is logged into the system, the first thing that they see is the dashboard.
The dashboard is tailored based on the role of the user.
