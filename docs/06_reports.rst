This is documentation for both a Facility Officer and the Reporting Role.


**The main tasks include:**
    #. Viewing major reports.
    #. Filtering to obtain refined and more relevant data.
    #. Export reports in formats such as Excel.




Reports Available
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To view all available categories of reports, a logged in user should click the
``Reports link`` on the main navigation bar. This opens up a view with a s
idebar listing possible reports user can view. An example is facility owners
report, clicked from the sidebar shows a grid listing names of different
categories of facility owners and the number of facilities each owns
respectively. For most of the other reports a user simply selects the link
from the sidebar and views the report with an option of *Exporting* the report
in Excel format.

from other reports, in that it has an **advanced search** pane to the left
that helps a logged in user to filter  facilities based on different criteria
including facilities found in a particular County, Sub-county to ward level;
as well as KEPH levels to name a few.
